# smart-mind-app
The project is a basic showcase of a full-stack JavaScript application in combination with a SQL database. The aim of the application is to detect faces in user provided images. A user can register via the web-app (CLIENT), login and provide urls to images via its created user profile. Provided images are handed over with API calls to the backend application (SERVER). On the server a third party Artificial-intelligence-API is called and its responses are processed as well as some data are stored via the backend application (DATABASE). The results are finally handed over to the client application and visually displayed inside the analyzed image.

The frontend part (CLIENT) is a React application that is a fully responsive website and uses some external libraries in order to have some visual effects available. 

*This showcase application is deployed on a free trier of Heroku.com*
